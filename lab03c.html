<h3> Implementation comparison </h3>


<p> So the implementation with html and css is more controlling for the developer as we can define the responsiveness as however we like and have much more control on how the page will
look. But the implementaion with bootstrap is like predefined by the frame works so the page already has a defined responsiveness based on input.</p>


<h3> challenges discussed</h3>

<p> The challenge with html and css that is part a is that everyything has to be declared by the developer and therefore it is much more tedious. And with bootstrap
 that is part b is that we don't have much controol on how the page will look as all the fonsta and sizes are mostly predefined. </p>

<h3> Time and prefernece </h3>
<p> My perefernece would be to use the part B as it takes less time and all the hard part of the responsiveness is already done by the frame work.So it requires much less time as well.
