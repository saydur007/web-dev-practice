<h1> My biography </h1>

<p> My life can me divided into two parts. The first part is early life and the last is my current life. Pretty normal life so far though. </p>

<article>
<h2> Early life </h2>


<p> I was born in Bangladesh but in a very early age I moved to Saudi Arabia with my parents where I lived 10 years of my life. Saudi Arbia was a magical place to live in 
as it is the centre of the Muslim world and I could visit the Holy Kabah Like every month. So I studied till grade 5 and in 2011 I moved back to my home country. In Bangladesh
I completed my high school and I applied to come to Canada for higher studies. </p>

<h2> My favourite Sports </h2>

<div>
<h3> Football </h3>
<p> Football is the most watched sports in the world and it has the largest following . My favorite footballer is Lionel Messi and he is genius. Football usually has 11 players each
side and the main goal is to put the ball into oppositions net. It is a fairly simple game and that is what I like about it.
</p>

<section>
<h3> Formula 1 motor racing </h3>

<p> Formula 1 is a racing sport where there is 20 drivers in the grid who try to cross the finish line. But there is so much more technicality to the sport than this.
It is a risky sport as all the drivers life is at risk because of the high spped nature of racing. My favorite driver is the goat Lewis Hamilton who drives for Mercedes. </p>

<summary> My flight to Canada </summary>
<p> My flight to Canada was a really life defining experience for me. It was the first time I flew alone without any of my family and friends and the flight was super long
. I learnt so many valuable lessons during that flight. For the first time I had to manage everything by myself and be self cautious. But I met some good people along the way
who helped me throughout my journey.</p>
